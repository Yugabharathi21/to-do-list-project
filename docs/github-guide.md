## Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

### 1. Create a New Repository

1. **Log in to GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in
   - Click the '+' icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"

2. **Configure repository settings**:
   - Repository name: `e-ink-todo`
   - Description: "A modern e-ink themed todo app built with the MERN stack"
   - Choose public or private visibility based on your needs
   - Initialize with a README file
   - Add a .gitignore for Node.js
   - Choose a license (MIT recommended for open-source)

3. **Create repository**:
   - Click "Create repository"

### 2. Clone Repository to Local Machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-ink-todo.git
cd e-ink-todo
```

### 3. Initial Project Setup

1. **Add your project files**:
   - Copy all project files to the cloned directory

2. **Create initial commit**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Version Control Best Practices

### 1. Branch Strategy

Implement a branching strategy such as:

- **main/production**: Production-ready code
- **development**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/feature-name**: Individual features
- **bugfix/bug-name**: Bug fixes
- **hotfix/fix-name**: Urgent production fixes

### 2. Creating and Managing Branches

```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/task-filtering

# Push new branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/task-filtering

# Switch between branches
git checkout development
```

### 3. Commit Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow a commit convention format:
  ```
  feat: add task filtering functionality
  fix: resolve date formatting issue in task cards
  docs: update API documentation
  style: improve spacing in task list
  refactor: simplify task creation logic
  test: add unit tests for task filters
  ```

- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Commit frequently with smaller, logical changes

### 4. Pull Requests

1. **Create Pull Request**:
   - Push your branch to GitHub
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Compare & pull request" for your branch
   - Add a descriptive title and detailed description
   - Link related issues using # followed by issue number

2. **Review Process**:
   - Request reviews from team members
   - Address feedback and make necessary changes
   - Discuss implementation details in comments

3. **Merging**:
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Resolve any merge conflicts
   - Choose appropriate merge strategy (merge commit, squash, rebase)
   - Delete the branch after merging if no longer needed

## GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### 1. Basic CI Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ development, production ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ development, production ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '18.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
```

### 2. Deployment Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ production ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '18.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
    # Add deployment steps for your specific hosting provider
    # Example for Vercel:
    - name: Deploy to Vercel
      uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
      with:
        vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
        vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
        vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
        vercel-args: '--prod'
```

## Collaborating Using GitHub Features

### 1. Issues

Use GitHub Issues to track:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Tasks and enhancements
- User stories

Create issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

```markdown
# Bug Report

**Description:**
A clear description of what the bug is.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. See error

**Expected Behavior:**
A clear description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots:**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Environment:**
- Browser: [e.g. Chrome, Safari]
- Version: [e.g. 22]
```

### 2. Project Boards

Set up a project board to track work:
1. Go to the "Projects" tab in your repository
2. Create a new project board
3. Choose a template (e.g., Basic kanban)
4. Add columns: To do, In progress, Review, Done
5. Add issues to the appropriate columns

### 3. Discussions

Enable GitHub Discussions for:
- Q&A
- General conversation
- Ideas and feedback
- Announcements

## Branch Protection and Code Review

### 1. Set Up Branch Protection

1. Go to your repository's "Settings"
2. Click on "Branches"
3. Add a branch protection rule for `main` and `development`:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators in these restrictions

### 2. Code Review Guidelines

Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with review guidelines:

```markdown
# Code Review Guidelines

## For Authors
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Write a clear description of changes
- Add screenshots for UI changes
- Run tests before submitting
- Respond to feedback promptly

## For Reviewers
- Review code promptly (within 24 hours if possible)
- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on:
  - Code correctness
  - Test coverage
  - Architecture and design
  - Security concerns
  - Code style and documentation
- Approve only when all issues are addressed
```

## Documentation on GitHub

### 1. Repository Documentation

Maintain these key documentation files:

- **README.md**: Overview, setup instructions, usage
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Contribution guidelines
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Community standards
- **SECURITY.md**: Security policies and reporting
- **LICENSE**: Project license

### 2. GitHub Wiki

For more extensive documentation, use GitHub Wiki:
1. Go to the "Wiki" tab in your repository
2. Create home page with an overview and navigation
3. Add additional pages for detailed documentation

### 3. GitHub Pages

For user-facing documentation:
1. Create a `docs` folder in your repository
2. Add markdown or HTML documentation
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Choose the `docs` folder as the source
5. Access at `https://yourusername.github.io/e-ink-todo/`

By following these guidelines, you'll establish a professional GitHub workflow for your E-ink Todo List Application that promotes collaboration, quality, and effective project management.
